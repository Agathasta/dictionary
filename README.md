# Dictionary
A project in Ruby File I/O and Regex by [The Viking School](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/professional-development-with-ruby/dictionary-reader).

Simple word search tool on the command line in Ruby. Even though it's called a "Dictionary", to keep it simple we're actually just searching for words in a word list (which is our "dictionary").

You can check it out online at [repl.it](https://repl.it/@Agathasta/dictionary#README.md).
